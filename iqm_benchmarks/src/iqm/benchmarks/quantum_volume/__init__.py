"""Quantum Volume reflects the deepest circuit a given number of qubits can execute with meaningful results.

Circuit Layer Operations per Second (CLOPS) reflects the speed at which parametrized quantum circuits can be executed
 (CLOPS_v corresponding to QV circuits, CLOPS_h to square, parallel-gate layered, circuits)
