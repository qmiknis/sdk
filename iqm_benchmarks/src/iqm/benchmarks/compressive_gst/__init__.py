"""Compressive GST is gate set tomography implementation specializing on low Kraus rank models.

It constructs the process matrices for a set of gates, as well as full parametrizations of an initial state and a POVM.
Low rank compression of the process matrix is used to reduce measurement and post-processing overhead.
