"""Standard compilation stages, their constituent compiler passes, and functions for implementing them.

There are 6 standard compilation stages:

1. Circuit-to-circuit.
2. Circuit-to-timebox.
3. Timebox-to-timebox.
4. Timebox-to-schedule.
5. Schedule-to-schedule.
6. Schedule-to-playlist.

Breakdown of compiler passes of each stage:

1. Circuit-to-circuit
*********************

1. Validate the circuit execution options.
2. Map backwards-compatible aliases for quantum operation names into the current name. This is needed until old
   operation names such as ``phased_rx`` and ``measurement`` are no longer supported.
3. Validate the contents of the circuits.
4. Map the logical QPU components to physical QPU components. Provided mapping is used, if any.
   Otherwise, identity mapping is used.
5. Choose implementations for circuit operations based on the calibration set.
6. Derive mapping between station acquisition labels and user's measurement keys. Populates ``readout_mappings`` and
   ``heralded_components`` of context.

2. Circuit-to-timebox
*********************

1. Resolve the circuits to timeboxes using :meth:`ScheduleBuilder.circuit_to_timebox`.

3. Timebox-to-timebox
*********************

1. Merge any MultiplexedProbeTimeBoxes inside each TimeBox using :meth:`TimeBox.composite`.
2. Add the heralding measurement timebox to all circuits if :class:`HeraldingMode` in circuit execution options
   requires it.
3. Add a reset timebox to all circuits.

4. Timebox-to-schedule
**********************

1. Resolve the timeboxes to schedules using :meth:`ScheduleBuilder.resolve_timebox`.

5. Schedule-to-schedule
***********************

1. Apply dynamical decoupling sequences to the schedule if requested.
2. Apply resonator-related phase corrections if MOVE gates are used.
3. Remove non-functional instructions from schedules using :meth:`ScheduleBuilder._finish_schedule`.

6. Schedule-to-playlist
***********************

1. Build the playlist from the schedules using :meth:`ScheduleBuilder.build_playlist`.

    This pass optimizes a situation where multiple "measure" gates on disjoint set of loci exist sequentially in the

    Without optimization, each gate would result in a separate trigger event, which results in worse performance.
    For example, with the measurement instructions [M(QB1), M(QB2), M(QB3)], we'd first measure QB1, then QB2, then QB3.
    This optimization merges the measurement timeboxes, so that we'll measure QB1, QB2, and QB3 at the same time
    (if the hardware channel configuration allows it), corresponding to M(QB1, QB2, QB3).

    Goes through the children of `circuit_box`, and places them in the same temporal order.
    Whenever a MultiplexedProbeTimeBox is encountered (i.e. from a measure gate), it is merged with the previous pending
    MultiplexedProbeTimeBox and left pending.
    If any other box type with colliding loci is encountered, first places the pending MultiplexedProbeTimeBox.
