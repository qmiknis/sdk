        * gate pattern: Gate pattern can be defined in two ways. It can be a string containing "X" and "Y" characters,

          XY4 sequence, "XYXYYXYX" to the EDD sequence, etc. If more flexibility is needed, a gate pattern can be
          defined as a sequence of PRX gate argument tuples (that contain a rotation angle and a phase angle). For
          example, sequence "YX" could be written as ``[(math.pi, math.pi / 2), (math.pi, 0)]``.

        * align: Controls the alignment of the sequence within the time window it is inserted in. Supported values:

          - "asap": Corresponds to a ASAP-aligned sequence with no waiting time before the first pulse.
          - "center": Corresponds to a symmetric sequence.
          - "alap": Corresponds to a ALAP-aligned sequence.

    The Dynamical Decoupling algorithm uses the best fitting gate sequence by first sorting them
    by ``ratio`` in descending order. Then the longest fitting pattern is determined by comparing ``ratio``
    with the duration of the time window divided by the PRX gate duration.
